# Search-Engine with AVL Search Tree

# CS300 – Spring 2023-2024 - Sabancı University
# Homework #2 – Search Engine


## Brief Description
In this project, I will write a search engine that preprocesses provided documents by inserting nodes for each unique word into an AVL Search Tree. You will also track the document name and the frequency of each word.

## Requirements
1. **AVL Search Tree:**
   - Implement a templated AVL Search Tree.
   - Each node should contain a unique word and track its occurrences across documents.
   
2. **Document Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocess the provided documents to extract words.
   - Insert words into the AVL Search Tree.
   - Track document names and word frequencies.
   
3. **Query Handling:**
   - Accept queries from the console.
   - Output document names and word frequencies for each query.

## Program Flow
1. Get the number of documents to preprocess.
2. Get the names of all documents from the console.
3. Preprocess the text in each document.
4. Insert unique words into the AVL Search Tree.
5. Track document names and word frequencies.
6. Accept a query from the console and output the results.
